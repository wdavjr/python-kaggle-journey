# Python Kaggle Journey
</br>

## üåü Overview

Welcome to my __Python Kaggle Journey__ repository! This repository documents my progress through Kaggle's Python course, where I am honing my skills in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization. As I navigate through various lessons and projects, I aim to build a solid foundation for a career in data science.

## üöÄ Learning Objectives

* __Master Python:__ Gain proficiency in Python, the most essential language for data science.
* __Hands-on Experience:__ Apply theoretical knowledge through practical exercises and projects.
* __Data Manipulation Skills:__ Learn to manipulate and analyze data effectively using Python.

## üìà Course Progress

* __Current Completion: 51%__
* __Certificate:__ [Link to your certificate (if applicable)]

## üìö Course Structure

The course consists of the following lessons, each designed to build on the previous one:

1. __Hello, Python__
   * An introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and basic data types.
2. __Functions and Getting Help__
   * Understanding how to use built-in functions, define your own, and leverage Python's documentation.
3. __Booleans and Conditionals__
   * Exploring boolean logic and conditional statements to control code flow.
4. __Lists__
   * A deep dive into lists, including indexing, slicing, and mutating elements.
5. __Loops and List Comprehensions__
   * Mastering for and while loops, along with the powerful feature of list comprehensions.
6. __Strings and Dictionaries__
   * Working with two fundamental data types in Python: strings and dictionaries.
7. __Working with External Libraries__
   * Learning how to import and use external libraries, and tips for navigating the Python ecosystem.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

* __Notebooks/:__ Jupyter notebooks for each lesson, featuring code examples and exercises.
* __Projects/:__ Mini-projects developed during the course to demonstrate my understanding.
* __Solutions/:__ Solutions to exercises provided as references for best practices.

## üí° Getting Started
